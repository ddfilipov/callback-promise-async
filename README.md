# Callbacks, Promises and async/await

Short [tutorial](https://youtu.be/JRNToFh3hxU) from LearnWebCode. Will be taking some notes to solidify concepts.

The tutorial's goal is to show the difference, especially in code-clarity, between `callbacks`, `Promises` with `.then()` and `Promises` with `async/await`.
