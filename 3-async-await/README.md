## Async/Await

We again have getCats, getDogs, and getBirds that return promises to retrieve data.

The functions which we are calling are at the bottom of the app.js and app.ts file.

`getCats().then();` this line right here would call `getCats()`, and we don't know how long this is gonna take, but when know that after it's been called hence the `.then()`, we're gonna call a function we're gonna give it.

This would be the result:

```js

```
